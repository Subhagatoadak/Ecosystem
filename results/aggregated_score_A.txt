To calculate the average score for the manga visual and normalize it to be out of 100, let's first extract all the numeric scores from the audience responses:

- Audience Member 1: 9, 8, 7, 8, 9
- Audience Member 2: 9, 8, 8, 9, 9
- Audience Member 3: 9, 8, 8, 9, 8
- Audience Member 4: 8, 9, 7, 8, 9
- Audience Member 5: 9, 8, 7, 8, 9

Now, add up all the scores:

\(9 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 204\)

There are a total of 25 scores (5 scores per audience member times 5 audience members).

Next, calculate the average score by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:

\(\text{Average Score} = \frac{204}{25} = 8.16\)

To normalize this score to be out of 100, multiply the average by 10:

\(\text{Normalized Score} = 8.16 \times 10 = 81.6\)

The final aggregated score, normalized to be out of 100, is 81.6.
