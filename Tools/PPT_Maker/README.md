The **Advanced PPT Creator App** is a modern, intuitive web application built with Streamlit and python‑pptx. This tool allows users to create customizable PowerPoint presentations with rich features including:

- Custom sections and slides.
- Background images for the title slide, sections, or individual slides.
- Flexible slide layouts with options for adding text, images, charts, and AI-rewritten content.
- Custom font settings (font size and type) for slide content.
- Integration with an LLM service (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) to rewrite slide content based on user prompts.

## Features

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  The app leverages a wide layout, custom CSS, and an organized sidebar for a super modern and intuitive design.

- **Slide Customization:**  
  Users can select from multiple slide layouts and add rich content to each slide. Customization options include:
  - Text content with adjustable font size and type.
  - Adding images as either background (full-slide) or foreground (smaller, positioned at the bottom-right).
  - Embedding charts using dummy data for visualization.

- **Section-Based Organization:**  
  Create sections to logically group your slides. Each section can have its own header and background image.

- **AI Content Rewriting:**  
  Use an integrated LLM service (via `generate_llm_response`) to automatically rewrite or enhance slide content based on custom prompts.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **python-pptx**  
- An LLM service integration (e.g., OpenAI) with the `llm_service` module set up in your project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-ppt-creator.git
   cd advanced-ppt-creator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Example `requirements.txt`:*
   ```
   streamlit
   python-pptx
   openai
   ```

4. **Project Setup:**

   Ensure your directory structure is as follows:

   ```
   advanced-ppt-creator/
   ├── llm_service/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── llm_generator.py
   ├── tools/
   │   └── ppt_maker/
   │       ├── __init__.py
   │       └── ppt_maker.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── README.md
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the App with Streamlit:**

   From the project root directory, run:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Tools/PPT_Maker/ppt_maker.py
   ```

2. **Using the App:**

   - **Basic Details:**  
     Enter your presentation title, description, and author details.

   - **Background Images:**  
     Choose whether to add a background image for the title slide or a common background for all content slides.

   - **Sections & Slides:**  
     Decide if you want to create sections. For each section, enter a title and specify the number of slides. For each slide:
       - Select a layout from a list of predefined options.
       - Input text content, and optionally modify font size and type.
       - Optionally upload an image to be used as a background or foreground.
       - Optionally add a chart using dummy data.
       - Optionally check a box to use AI to rewrite the content, and provide an AI prompt.

   - **Generate & Download:**  
     Click **Generate PPT** to create your PowerPoint file and then use the provided download button to save your presentation.

## Project Structure

```

│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── llm_generator.py       # Contains the `generate_llm_response` function.
├── tools/

└── README.md                  # Project documentation.
```

## Customization

- **Custom CSS & UI:**  
  The app uses injected CSS in the Streamlit markdown to create a modern, clean UI. You can modify the CSS in the `ppt_maker.py` file to change fonts, colors, spacing, and more.

- **Slide Layout Options:**  
  Modify the `layout_options` dictionary to add or change available slide layouts based on your PowerPoint template.

- **LLM Integration:**  
  The `generate_llm_response` function (imported from `llm_service.llm_generator`) is used to rewrite slide content based on user prompts. Customize this function as needed for your preferred LLM provider.
